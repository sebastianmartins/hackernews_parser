### CODING PROTOCOL ###
Coding instructions:
- Write the absolute minimum code required
- No sweeping changes
- No unrelated edits - focus on just the task you’re on
- Make code precise, modular, testable
- Don’t break existing functionality
- If I need to do anything (e.g. API keys/AWS config), tell me clearly.
